## Image Denoising with Principal Component Analysis

### Organization:

**Benchmarking** Contains the Numba and NumPy optimized implementations for each of the studied algorithmic variants

**Main** Contains older implementations of the algorithms and code to apply the denoised images to the classifier

**Example Code** Contains a simple implementation of a CNN trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset

**Paper** Contains the final report and proposal
